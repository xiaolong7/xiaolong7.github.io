Passive materials in human skeletal muscle tissues play an important role in force output of skeletal muscles. This paper introduces a multiscale modeling framework to investigate how age-associated variations on microscale passive muscle components, including microstructural geometry (e.g., connective tissue thickness) and material properties (e.g., anisotropy), influence the force output and deformations of the continuum skeletal muscle. We first define a representative volume element (RVE) for the microstructure of muscle and determine the homogenized macroscale mechanical properties of the RVE from the separate mechanical properties of the individual components of the RVE, including muscle fibers and connective tissue with its associated collagen fibers. The homogenized properties of the RVE are then used to define the elements of the continuum muscle model to evaluate the force output and deformations of the whole muscle. Conversely, the regional deformations of the continuum model are fed back to the RVE model to determine the responses of the individual microscale components. Simulations of muscle isometric contractions at a range of muscle lengths are performed to investigate the effects of muscle architectural changes (e.g., pennation angles) due to aging on force output and muscle deformation. The correlations between the pennation angle, the shear deformation in the microscale connective tissue (an indicator for the lateral force transmission), the angle difference between the fiber direction and principal strain direction and the resulting shear deformation at the continuum scale, as well as the force output of the skeletal muscle are also discussed.
